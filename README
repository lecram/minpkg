This is a minimal package manager implemented in a single shell script.

Package metadata is maintained as plain text in /etc/pkg.

Packages are *.tgz files with paths relative to the root directory.
Path names in packages must not begin with a slash.
Path names in packages must not contain whitespaces.

Usage:
  minpkg [-r ROOT] COMMAND [ARGS]

Most commands need a ROOT argument that is the root path of the target file system.
For example, to manage packages on the current rootfs, use "/" as the ROOT argument.
The ROOT argument is searched in the following order:
  1. the -r command-line option;
  2. $MINPKG_ROOT environment variable;
  3. current working directory.

Commands:
  init
    initialize package management on ROOT
    this creates skeleton metadata structure on ROOT/etc/pkg
  list
    print the name (PKGID) of all packages installed on ROOT
    packages are listed in order of priority (lower first)
  add PKGFILE
    install package from PKGFILE (a *.tgz file) to ROOT
    the PKGID is inferred from PKGFILE (/path/to/foo.tgz -> foo)
  del PKGID
    uninstall package named PKGID from ROOT
  pack PKGID
    create tarball from installed package
  raise PKGID
    give all files from PKGID top priority on conflicts under ROOT
  from PATH
    print PKGID of the package effectively providing PATH on ROOT
  match PATH
    print PKGID of all packages providing PATH on ROOT
    packages are listed in order of priority (higher first)
  to PKGFILE
    print the path of each file in the package

It's sufficient to type only the first character of a command (r -> raise).

A conflict occurs when a new package installs a path that was already provided by another one.
In this situation, minpkg saves a backup of the old file before installing the new one.
If the newer package is uninstalled, the backup file will be restored to its original path.
The commands "from" & "raise" may be used to solve conflicts manually.
